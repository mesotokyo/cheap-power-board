Note 1: It is recommended to use capaciters with a rated voltage of 16V or higher.
Note 2: Please use a diode with a rated voltage of 16V or higher and a rated current of 1A or higher. Also you can use normal diode instead of schottky diode D1.
Note 3: It is recommendedto use shottky diode with a rated voltage of 25V or higher for D2 and D3. 
Note 4: If you want to change the brightness of the LEDs, please change the value of the resistors R1, R2, R3.
Note 5: You can also use generic voltage regulator (5V), but through holes of the U3 are small, so it's better to check the pin size in advance.
